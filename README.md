  <h1> Exzo Network SDK </h1>
</div>


The Exzo Network SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications. [Tendermint Core (BFT Consensus)](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) and the Cosmos SDK are written in the Go programming language. Cosmos SDK is used to build [Gaia](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia), the implementation of the Cosmos Hub.

**WARNING**: The Cosmos SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some breaking changes.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.19+](https://go.dev/dl)

## Quick Start

To learn how the Cosmos SDK works from a high-level perspective, see the Cosmos SDK [High-Level Intro](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/intro/overview.html).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of Cosmos SDK, visit [Cosmos SDK Tutorials](https://tutorials.cosmos.network). You can also fork the tutorial's repository to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.

For more information, see the [Cosmos SDK Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network).
